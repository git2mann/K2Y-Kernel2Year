# K2Y (Kernel2Year) 🕰️

A unique 2D puzzle-platformer where you navigate a glitched 8-bit computer simulation with reverse time mechanics caused by the Y2K bug.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Navigate through a corrupted 8-bit simulation where time flows backward due to a catastrophic Y2K computer glitch. Master reverse physics and causality to overcome obstacles including explosions that occur in reverse and enemies that reassemble from death.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Controls
- **WASD/Arrow Keys**: Player movement
- **Spacebar**: Jump
- **Q**: System Restore (freeze reverse time)
- **E**: Temporal Debug (pause nearby reverse objects)

## 🔧 Core Systems

- **Reverse Time Manager**: Central system managing backward time flow
- **Player Controller**: Standard 2D platformer movement
- **Temporal Abilities**: Q and E key powers to manipulate time
- **Environmental Effects**: Objects that explode and reassemble in reverse
